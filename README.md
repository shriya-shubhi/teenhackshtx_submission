Our Problem: During the coronavirus pandemic, many high school and middle school students have been following different sleep-work schedules than they would normally follow in schools. Some have been early risers while others have been night owls. This pattern results in each student having a different time when he / she is alert. However, regardless of alertness, all of them have to attends class at the same time.

Our Solution: This program will learn from students' activity pattern throughout the day. The program will relay the information that it collects to the teachers and schools so that they can set up different class times for different batches of students.
